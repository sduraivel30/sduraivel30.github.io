I am a **Postdoctoral Associate** at the [McGovern Institute for Brain Research](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/) at MIT, working with [Prof. Evelina Fedorenko](https://evlab.mit.edu/) and [Prof. Mark Richardson](https://www.brainmodulationlab.org/). My research investigates the neural mechanisms underlying language processing using intracranial recordings and computational modeling techniques.

I completed my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at Duke University, where I conducted research with [Prof. Gregory B. Cogan](https://www.coganlab.org/) and [Prof. Jonathan Viventi](https://viventi.pratt.duke.edu/). My dissertation focused on uncovering the cortical mechanisms of human speech for both brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and speech neuroscience. Before that, I completed my masters in Biomedical Engineering at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
