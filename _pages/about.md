I am a **Postdoctoral Associate** at the [McGovern Institute for Brain Research](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/) at MIT, working with [Prof. Evelina Fedorenko](https://fedorenko.mit.edu/) and [Prof. Mark Richardson](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/mark-richardson/). My research investigates the neural mechanisms underlying language processing and speech production using intracranial electrophysiology, high-resolution neural recordings, and computational modeling.

## Research Focus

My work combines advanced neuroimaging techniques with computational approaches to understand how the human brain supports language and speech. I use high-density micro-ECoG arrays to record neural activity directly from the human cortex during language tasks, providing unprecedented insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of language processing.

## Current Projects

- **Neural mechanisms of language comprehension**: Using intracranial recordings to characterize how neural populations encode semantic and syntactic information during naturalistic language processing
- **High-resolution speech decoding**: Developing machine learning algorithms to decode speech from cortical activity with applications to neural prosthetics
- **Cross-modal language representations**: Investigating how the brain integrates auditory and motor signals during speech production and comprehension
